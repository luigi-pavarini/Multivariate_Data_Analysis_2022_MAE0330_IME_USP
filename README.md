# Multivariate_Data_Analysis_2022_MAE0330_IME_USP

In MAE0330, an exciting undergraduate discipline at IME USP, I had the pleasure of diving into a rich toolbox of multivariate techniques! ðŸ§°ðŸ’¡

ðŸ“Š During the course, I explored various powerful methods like:
- Cluster Analysis
- Principal Component Analysis
- Factor Analysis
- EM and Procrustes
- Correspondence Analysis
- Discriminant Analysis
- Multivariate Regression
- Canonical Correlation Analysis

These techniques not only expanded my analytical horizons but also granted me the ability to uncover hidden patterns, unravel complex relationships, and make predictions from multivariate datasets. These skills are truly useful for holding on multivariate data analysis problems. ðŸš€âœ¨
