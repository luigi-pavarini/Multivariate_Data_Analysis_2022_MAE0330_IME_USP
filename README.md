# Multivariate Data Analysis 2022 (MAE0330 IME-USP)

In MAE0330, an exciting undergraduate discipline at IME USP, I had the pleasure of diving into a rich toolbox of multivariate techniques! ðŸ§°ðŸ’¡

ðŸ“Š During the course, I explored various powerful methods like:
1. Cluster Analysis (Grade: 100/100)
2. Principal Component Analysis (Grade: 90/100)
3. Factor Analysis(Grade: 80/100)
4. EM and Procrustes (Grade: 85/100)
5. Correspondence Analysis (Grade: 60/100)
6. Discriminant Analysis (Grade: 80/100)
7. Multivariate Regression (Grade: 100/100)
8. Canonical Correlation Analysis (Grade: 100/100)

These techniques not only expanded my analytical horizons but also granted me the ability to uncover hidden patterns, unravel complex relationships, and make predictions from multivariate datasets. These skills are truly useful for holding on multivariate data analysis problems. ðŸš€âœ¨
